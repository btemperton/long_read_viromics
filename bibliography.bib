  abstract = "Summary: ViPTree is a web server provided through GenomeNet to
              generate viral proteomic trees for classification of viruses
              based on genome-wide similarities. Users can upload viral genomes
              sequenced either by genomics or metagenomics. ViPTree generates
              proteomic trees for the uploaded genomes together with flexibly
              selected reference viral genomes. ViPTree also serves as a
              platform to visually investigate genomic alignments and
              automatically annotated gene functions for the uploaded viral
              genomes, thus providing virus researchers the first choice for
              classifying and understanding newly sequenced viral genomes.
              Availability and Implementation: ViPTree is freely available at:
              http://www.genome.jp/viptree . Contact: goto@kuicr.kyoto-u.ac.jp.
              Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at
